# python-pool-scraper
A project to extract and use swimming pool schedules from https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks. Built in Python using BeautifulSoup.

Status as of 1/31/16: work in progress. 

Done:	
	Have created a script to extract and process the data from a sample page. 

Next steps:
	Clean up the script and make it more extensible. 
	Write a scraper that can find the relevant data on a page and find the relevant pages within the portlandoregon.gov site.
	Create a web app to display the data. Probably Flask, but I'm not committed to anything yet.
