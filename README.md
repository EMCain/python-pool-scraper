# python-pool-scraper
A project to extract and use swimming pool schedules from https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks. Built in Python using Flask and BeautifulSoup.

Changes 3/2/16

Done:
	I made a bunch of (paper) notes last night outlining the functions I need to write and the database structure I want.
	Today I typed up an extended version of the web scraper script outline in script-outlines/scraper.py

Next steps:
	Continue typing up and elaborating on the paper notes. 
	Write unit tests for the outlined functions. 
	Learn about database interactions in Flask, and create the database I need. 
	Implement and test the outlined functions.
	Create a bare-bones front end interface. I have all kinds of fun ideas about how I'd like it to look eventually, but I think it'll be more important to get *something* up and running. 
	
Project thoughts:
	Here are some of my goals for this project, in terms of what I hope to learn and practice:
		- test-driven development in Python. I've taken a Treehouse tutorial on it but am having a hard time wrapping my head around real-world usage of the concept. 
		- get better at front-end development (especially CSS) without Bootstrap. It's a great tool but I've become overly dependent on it. 
	I'll add more goals as I think of them.

Created 1/31/16 

Done:	
	Have created a script to extract and process the data from a sample page. 

Next steps:
	Clean up the script and make it more extensible. 
	Write a scraper that can find the relevant data on a page and find the relevant pages within the portlandoregon.gov site.
	Create a web app to display the data. Probably Flask, but I'm not committed to anything yet.
